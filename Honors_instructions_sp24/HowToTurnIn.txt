If you are on Android Studio, you can use the option of File -> Export -> Export to Zip file and choose the location where you want the final zip to be. This will export all the files needed to reconstruct the program. You can always test before submitting by extracting the newly generated zip, then you can open and run it in a new Android Studio window to see if the file can be rebuilt and would work correctly.
